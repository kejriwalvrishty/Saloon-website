				<h1> FACIALS </h1>
				<p>A facial is a family of skin care treatments for the face, including steam, exfoliation, extraction, creams, lotions, facial masks, peels, and massage.There are different kinds of masks (e.g. cactus, cucumber, etc.) for different purposes: deep-cleansing, by penetrating the pores; healing acne scars or hyper-pigmentation; brightening, for a gradual illumination of the skin tone. Some masks are designed to dry or solidify on the face, almost like plaster; others just remain wet. The perceived effects of a facial mask treatment include revitalizing, healing, or refreshing; and, may yield temporary benefits (depending on environmental, dietary, and other skincare factors). There is little to no objective evidence that there are any long-term benefits to the various available facial treatments.</p>

				<h1> SPA </h1>
				<p>different types of spa</p>
				<p>1.Ayurvedic spa:	
								Originating in India, Ayurveda - meaning ‘the knowledge for long life’ in Sanskrit - is the oldest known health practice in the world and the focus of spas with the same name. The treatments aim to boost immunity and prevent disease, delay ageing and promote overall wellbeing. All Ayurvedic treatments are prescriptive.
					2.Bootcamp spa:
								Bootcamp spas offer the treatments one would expect at a traditional spa (massages, facials, manicure etc.), in addition to vigorous workout classes and educational talks, which aim to help participants learn how to make better lifestyle choices for improved health.
					3.Day spa:
								Unlike spa hotels, day spas provide no overnight accommodation. Guests are welcome to enjoy massages, facials and body scrubs and wraps (note: individual spa menus vary), and make use of onsite leisure facilities during normal working hours, on weekdays and weekends. Day spas can differ greatly. Some are large, luxurious and self-contained affairs, while others are quainter and comprise several rooms within a sizeable hair or beauty salon. </p>
